# Oni configuration

Here lay available an [onivim](https://onivim.io) configuration folder.

This is catered to my own preference, however anyone is free to
make use of this configuration.

The plugins included as submodules are obviously not my own work, 
unless otherwise stated. All credit goes out to their 
amazing authors!
